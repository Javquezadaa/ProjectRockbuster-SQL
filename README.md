# ProjectRockbuster-SQL

**Rockbuster Stealth LLC** is a movie rental company that once operated physical stores around the globe. Facing intense competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster is now planning to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive in the digital era.

To support this strategic shift, the Business Intelligence (BI) department has been tasked with analyzing internal data to drive key decisions.
